Experimenting with Coordinated Omission
==

You might read the **[paper](paper.md)** which covers the following:

* definition of Coordinated Omission a term coined by Gil Tene
* problem analysis
* a possible correction scheme (using some simple assumptions)

**Experimenting** is still work in progress.

For experimenting a simple **benchmarking tool** is developed. It is [work in progress](TODO.md), is in the pre-alpha stage.
